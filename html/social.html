<h2>What this task is about</h2>
  <p>This task involves reading sentences from political texts and judging whether they deal with social policy, or not.</p>

  <p>The sentences you will be asked to interpret come from political party manifestos. Some of these sentences will deal directly with social policy; other sentences will have no reference to social policy. We tell you below about what we mean by "social" policy.</p>

  <p>First, you will read a short section from a party manifesto. For the sentence highlighted in red, enter your best judgment about whether it mainly refers to social policy, or not.</p>
  
  <p>If the sentence does refers to social policy, select "Social" in the drop down menu. If the sentence does not refer to social policy, select "Not Social" &ndash;  in this case you will move directly to the next sentence.</p>

  <p>If you select "Social", you will then be shown a policy scale. Use this to give your best judgment of the sentence in terms of how much it is liberal or conservative. We tell you below about what we mean by "liberal" and "conservative" etc..</p>

  <p>For example, if you see a sentence containing what you think is very conservative social policy, select the "Social" policy area from the drop down menu and click "very conservative" on the social policy scale.</p>

  <p>If you believe the sentence expresses a centrist social policy OR concerns social policy but does not express any clear position, select the appropriate social policy category from the drop down menu, as above, and then click the "neither&hellip;nor&hellip;position on the scale.</p>

  <p>Now we need to tell you about what we mean by "social" policy, and "liberal" and "conservative".</p>


  <h3>What is "social" policy? What are "liberal" or "conservative" social policies?</h3>

  <p><strong>"Social" policies</strong> deal with aspects of social and moral life, relationships between social groups, and matters of national and social identity, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Policing, crime, punishment and rehabilitation of offenders;</li>
    <li>Immigration, relations between social groups, discrimination and multiculturalism;</li>
    <li>The role of the state in regulating the social and moral behavior of individuals</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>"Liberal" social policies</strong> tend to favor one or more of the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Policies emphasizing prevention of crime, rehabilitation of convicted criminals.</li>
    <li>The right of individuals to make personal moral choices on matters such as abortion, gay rights, and euthanasia;</li>
    <li>Policies penalizing discrimination against particular social groups and/or favoring a multicultural society</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>"Conservative" social policies</strong> tend to favor one or more of the following:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Policies emphasizing more aggressive policing, increasing police numbers, conviction and punishment of criminals, building more prisons</li>
    <li>The right of society to regulate personal moral choices on matters such as abortion, gay rights, and euthanasia;</li>
    <li>Policies favoring restriction of immigration, and/or opposing explicit provision of state services for minority cultures.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Text Examples</h2>

  <p>Below we provide an examples of text from the manifestos and instructions on how they should be coded, and why.</p>

  <h3>Example: "Liberal" social policy:</h3>

    <div class="manifesto_text">ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON. Every effort should be made to ensure that fine defaulters, elderly shoplifters and drunks are not sent to prison. <strong><font color="red">Police cautions and intermediate treatment should be more widely used.</font></strong> Where punishment is appropriate, it should normally be community service rather than prison
    </div>

  <p>The highlighted text should be coded as having to do with "<em>social</em>" policy because it references policing.  In addition the text is "<em>liberal</em>" because it promotes alternative punitive measures to prison.</p>
