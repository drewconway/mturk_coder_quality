The following repository is a collection of code, data, and web frameworks for experiments to enhance coder quality in Mechanical Turk jobs.  These experiments will generate data to be used in a paper treatment of this study.

These results will additionally be reported in a larger, co-authored, paper on using crowd-source to code political text.
